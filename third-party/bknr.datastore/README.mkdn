# bknr.datastore

An in-memory CLOS based data store. This is a significant fork of the
very fantastic bknr.datastore.

# Changes from OG version

* The data format on disk is unchanged
* Lispworks support: we've been running this in LW for several years now.
* Multiple hook points to support things like file locks, and multiple datastore reading but only one writing.
* Slot accessors on STORE-OBJECTs no longer need to be wrapped in WITH-TRANSACTION.
* WITH-TRANSACTION is a no-op
  - In particular, we no longer support rollbacks
  - WITH-TRANSACTION is generally complicated, difficult for a n00b to understand, and has a lot of rough edges (for instance, it does not rollback changes to indices)
  - But, it also enabled an easy way to batch multiple IO requests. Without WITH-TRANSACTION, the only way to batch IO requests is to create an explicit named transaction.
  - Removing the ability of rollbacks also allows us to implement things like Raft consensus protocol for High Availability situations.
* There are probably bunch of other small changes in here that have accumulated over time.

# Planned changes from OG version

* Asynchronous snapshots
* Getting rid of skip-lists and replacing with fset. (required for async snapshots)
* There's a bug somewhere that makes indexes fail during hot reloads. This bug is non-deterministic and has been bugging me for years. The workaround is to never define an index on a slot using `:index-type ...`. Instead define an index in a `defvar` and then use `:index *my-index*`.
* bknr.cluster... will be a separate repository but we'll continually make changes to bknr.datastore to support it.
