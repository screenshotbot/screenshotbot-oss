;;;; * Introduction

;;;; FiveAM is a testing framework. It takes care of all the boring
;;;; bookkeeping associated with managing a test framework allowing
;;;; the developer to focus on writing tests and code.

;;;; FiveAM was designed with the following premises:

;;;; - Defining tests should be about writing tests, not
;;;; infrastructure. The developer should be able to focus on what
;;;; they're testing, not the testing framework.

;;;; - Interactive testing is the norm. Common Lisp is an interactive
;;;; development environment, the testing environment should allow the
;;;; developer to quickly and easily redefine, change, remove and run
;;;; tests.
